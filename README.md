# bvis -- binary visualiser

`bvis` is a tool to visualise binary files.  The concept is strongly borrowed
from [binvis.io](http://binvis.io) and from
[scurve](https://github.com/cortesi/scurve), both by Aldo Cortesi.

Currently it outputs a [Netpbm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format)
stream to standard output.

`bvis` is written in C in the C99 standard, and has no external dependencies.
